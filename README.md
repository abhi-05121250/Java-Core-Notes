# Java Core Notes 📚

Welcome to my repository where I'll be sharing my Java Core notes every weekend! This is not a tutorial or a study guide, just my own notes that might help you navigate through the vast world of Java.

Feel free to use, adapt, and contribute. As they say, "Gyan baatne se badhta hai!" 🌱
